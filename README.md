In this project, we aim to use neural networks for automatic music generation. Since music is sequential data, it can be modelled using a sequential deep learning model as a recurrent neural network which is a member of feedback neural network. Therefore, a RNN will be trained to learn the music sequence, and this will help in generating the sequence of music data.
